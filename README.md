# GoogleAppWidgetSample

[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/l/rustc-serialize.svg?maxAge=2592000)]()

A sample app widget from the course Advanced Android Development by Google. 

The AppWidgetSample app demonstrates a simple app widget. Because the app demonstrates app widgets, the app's main activity is minimal, with one explanatory text view.

The actual app widget has two panels for information and a button.

The panels display:

* The app widget ID. The user can place multiple widget instances on their home screen. An internal ID identifies each widget.
* How many times the widget has been updated, and the last update time.
* An Update now button, to request an immediate update.
